## About the Website
The public-facing website is built using **Rust**, leveraging its performance, memory safety, and modern web ecosystem.  
This component provides CEI’s external interface, designed to be fast, secure, and reliable.

---

## About the Management System
The CEI internal Management System is developed using **JavaScript**, enabling:

- Rapid development of admin tools  
- A strong UI ecosystem for dashboards  
- Easy integration with existing JS libraries  
- Flexibility for frequent updates and changes  

JavaScript is used here because it is ideal for administrative frontends and dynamic interfaces.
